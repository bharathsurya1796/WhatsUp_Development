Best Practices to Automate a Testcase

# Manual perform test steps to understand the flow
# In parallel, capture the following 
    - action (selenium method)
    - locator (xpath/id)
    - verification (assert)
# Code the steps with comments
# Debug the steps with break points (TDD)
# Execute them for different data
# Push the code to git repo
# Execute through Jenkins Pipeline
# Report the results
